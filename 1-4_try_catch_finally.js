/* 1.4 Implement exception handling 
â€¢ try, catch, finally 
 */


/* Purpose: to handle runtime errors from things like invalid input, 
file read/write errors,  or 
network failures without disrupting program execution 

Core idea is the code that may throw an error is wrapped in a try 
block and errors are caught and handled in the catch block.*/

/* TRY BLOCK
contains the code that may throw an error
if no error occurs, the try catch block is ignored 
a try block cannot stand alone without a catch or a finally

CATCH BLOCK
executes if an error is thrown in the try block
provides access to the error object for inspection and handling 


FINALLY BLOCK
always executes regardless of whether or not an error occurred
useful for cleanup actions like closing files, stopping loaders or 
clearing resources

A single try block can have
 - one or none catch block
 - one or none finally block

You can have multiple independent try-catch-finally constructs in a script.
You can nest try-catch-finally in any one of the try-catch-finally blocks

  /* ERROR OBJECT
  when an error occurs, the catch block recieves the error object
  this object contains information properties:
  name -> The type of error (such as ReferenceError)
  message -> Description of the error
  stack -> stack trace showing where the error occured

    console.log("Error Message:", error.message); // Unexpected token i in JSON at position 1
    console.log("Stack Trace:", error.stack); // Stack trace details
  }

  // Basic Try-Catch Example
  try {
    let result = 10 / x; //throws a ReferenceError because x was not defined
  } catch(error) {
    console.log('Error: ',error.message);

  //Using finally for cleanup:

        throw new Error("Outer error triggered!"); //Re-throws error
    }
  } catch (outerError) {
    console.log('Outer catch: ', outerError.message);
  }

  /* Best Practices
  - Wrap ony the code likely to throw errors in try blocks
  - use console.error or send logs to an external logging system 
  - Provide user-friendly messages or fallback mechanisms when errors occur
  - use finally to free up resources or reset states to ensure the program remains stable
  - always handle errors, don't leave catch blocks empty
  - preempt errors by validating inputs before attempting risky operations

  /* You can use try-finally without a catch.  
  This creates executable code that must run regardless of whether an 
  exception occurs or not without handling the error explicitly.
   
  The try block contains the code that might throw an exception.
  The finally block executes after the try block regarless of whether
  an error occurred or not. The finally block is still used for clearn-up
  tasks like closing files, stopping loaders, or releasing resources.
  
  With no catch block, if the exception occurs, it propogates (bubbles) to 
  high levels in the call stack

  You might use try-finally when 
   - you don't care about handling the error in the current function 
    but still want to guarantee clean up before the error propagates
    for example, if you're working in a utility function where another
    part of the application will handle the error.
    If you don't need to handle the error right there, adding a catch 
    block would be unnecessary and redundant.  letting the error propagate
    allows a higher-level part of the program to handle it.

When an error occurs in a try block and isn't handled (there is no catch block)
the error propagates up the call stack which means the error moves to the 
calling function and so on until 
- a higher level function has a try-catch block to handle it
- the error reaches the global scope (uncaught error) which can crash the
    application

  function level3() {
    throw new Error("Error in level3");
  }
  
  try {
    level1();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Caught error:", error.message); // "Caught error: Error in level3"
  }
/*the error in lvel3 propagates up through level2 and level1 until it 
is caught in the try catch block 

Is this bad? Not inherently
If no catch block exists, the error doesn't disappear silently.
It moves up the stack until its handled or logged
You can handle errors in one central location making debugging and 
recovery easier.
It can be problematic if you don't want errors to reach the global scope or 
if you want to handle specific types of errors locally before they 
propagate.

A catch block can prevent propagagion but it depends on what you do inside
the block.  If you rethrow the error, it will continue propagating.

//stopping propagagion:
try {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong!");

  console.log("Program continues...");

  // Caught error: Something went wrong!
